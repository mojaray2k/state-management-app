# Thunks

There are usually three stages of an a**synchronous request**. 
1. First is the start of the request. 
2. Second is if the request succeeds. 
3. Third is if the request fails. 

The best UIs account for and inform the user about each stage.

It’s important that your state accounts for each of these stages. If we were to design the initial state of a specific reducer based on the information above, that would probably look something like this -

```javascript
const initialState = {
  data: [],
  isFetching: false,
  error: ''
}
```
Now the reducer that corresponds with that initial state might look like this

```javascript
function reducer (state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'FETCHING_DATA' :
      return {
        ...state,
        isFetching: true
      }
    case 'FETCHING_DATA_ERROR' :
      return {
        ...state,
        isFetching: false,
        error: action.error,
      }
    case 'FETCHING_DATA_SUCCESS' : 
      return {
        ...state,
        isFetching: false,
        error: null,
        data: action.data
      }
  }
}
```
Notice that we're handling every possible situation. **Begin request**. **Request succeeded**. **Request failed**. Now that we have our reducer and initial state, our actions creators should be obvious.

```javascript
function fetchingData () {
  return {
    type: 'FETCHING_DATA'
  }
}
function fetchingDataError (error) {
  return {
    type: 'FETCHING_DATA_ERROR',
    error: error.msg
  }
}
function fetchingDataSuccess (data) {
  return {
    type: 'FETCHING_DATA_SUCCESS',
    data,
  }
```
Now a common situation for when we want to make an asynchronous request is when a component will mount. Pretend we have a function called `getData()` that is **asynchronous** and returns us a **promise**. Let's see how `getData` will interact with our **action creators** above.

```javascript
componentDidMount () {
  const { dispatch } = this.props
  dispatch(fetchingData())
  getData()
    .then((data) => dispatch(fetchingDataSuccess(data)))
    .catch((error) => dispatch(fetchingDataError(error)))
}
```
Now this doesn't look too bad, but it's kind of a pain to have to import all of those action creators into our component and then mix that data fetching logic with our UI logic. The reason we're having to make an async request is because the action creators need that data which doesn't exist locally. Well, if it's the action creators which need certain data, why don't we give the responsibility of getting that data to the action creators themselves rather than relying on the component to do that?

Assuming we had an action creator that was able to do this called 'fetchAndHandleData', our componentDidMount would then look like this,

```javascript
componentDidMount () {
  this.props.dispatch(fetchAndHandleData())
}
```
Much nicer right? And now we've kept all of those other action creators locally scoped to their file as well as not polluting our component code with the data fetching code.

But now in order to do this, we're going to need to have access to "dispatch" in our action creator somehow. To do this, we created a custom middleware which is responsible for checking if the action was an object or a function. If it's an object, it behaves as it normally does. If it's a function, it invokes it passing it dispatch.

```javascript
const thunk = (store) => (next) => (action) => {
  if (typeof action === 'function') {
    return action(store.dispatch)
  }
  return next(action)
}
```
Now, assuming we've told our store about our thunk middleware, we can now move the data fetching logic from our components to our action creators.

```javascript
export function fetchAndHandleData () {
  return (dispatch) => {
      dispatch(fetchingData())
      getData()
          .then((data) => dispatch(fetchingDataSuccess(data)))
          .catch((error) => dispatch(fetchingDataError(error)))
  }
}
```
